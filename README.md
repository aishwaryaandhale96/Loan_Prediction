## Project Overview 📚
This project involves:
1. Loading and exploring the dataset 📂
2. Preprocessing the data 🔄
3. Building and training a neural network model 🏗️
4. Evaluating the model's performance 📊
5. Visualizing the training process 🖼️

## Data 📊
The dataset used in this project is loaded from a CSV file. It contains several features and a target variable that we aim to predict. The data is split into training and test sets, and the features are standardized for optimal performance.

## Model 🧠
A neural network model is built using TensorFlow and Keras. The model architecture includes:
- An input layer
- Two hidden layers with ReLU activation
- An output layer with sigmoid activation

The model is compiled with binary cross-entropy loss and the Adam optimizer.

## Results 📈
The model is trained for 50 epochs, and its performance is evaluated on the test set. The final test accuracy is approximately 76%. Training and validation accuracy and loss are visualized to monitor the model's performance during training.

## Usage 📝
Open the Jupyter notebook and run the cells sequentially. The notebook is organized into sections with explanations, code, and visualizations.

## Contributing 🤝
Contributions are welcome! If you have suggestions for improvements or new features, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
